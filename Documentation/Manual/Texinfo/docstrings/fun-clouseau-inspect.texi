@anchor{Function clouseau:inspect}
@deffn {Function} {@symbol{inspect,clouseau}} object &key new-process
Inspect @var{object} in a new inspector window.

Return two values: 1) @var{object} 2) the created inspector application
frame.

If @var{new-process} is false (the default), this function returns to
the caller after the inspector window has been closed. If
@var{new-process} is true, this function returns to the caller
immediately and the inspector frame executes in a separate thread.
@end deffn
